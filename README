NEATMKFN
========

The Neatmkfn program creates Neatroff font description files from AFM
(Adobe Font Metrics), TrueType, and OpenType fonts.  See the output of
"mkfn -h" for the available options.  Note that for OpenType fonts,
Neatmkfn cannot obtain glyph bounding boxes accurately.  Therefore, if
you plan to use a font in Neateqn blocks, convert the font to TrueType
and generate the font description from that.

The included ./gen.sh script invokes mkfn to create a complete output
device for neatroff.  Change the variables in that file before running
it.
